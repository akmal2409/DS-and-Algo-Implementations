# DS-and-Algo-Implementations
Implementation of different algorithms and data structures.
This repository is just for me to keep my implementations of different algorithms and DS. Hopefully in 2-3 months I will be able to crack medium problems using those!
# Study material
I am using the book Data Structures and Algorithms in Java by Michael T. Goodrich and I am quite fascinated by it. Recommend to everyone who is reading this. Probably noone xD
